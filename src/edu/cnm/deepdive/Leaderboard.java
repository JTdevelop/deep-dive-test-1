/**
 * The static methods of this class compute rankings of an input array of scores against a
 * leaderboard of scores.
 *
 * We want to determine Alice's rank as she progresses up the leaderboard. For example, the four
 * players on the leaderboard have high scores of 100, 90, 90, and 80. Using dense ranking those
 * players will have ranks 1, 2, 2, and 3 respectively. If Alice's scores are 70, 80 and 105, her
 * rankings after each game using dense ranking are 4, 3 and 1.
 *
 * You are given an array, <code>leaderboard</code>, of monotonically decreasing leaderboard scores,
 * and another array, <code>scores</code>, of Alice's scores for the game. You must print j
 * integers. The jth integer should indicate the current rank of Alice after her jth game.
 *
 * <h3>Sample Input</h3>
 * <pre><code>
 * 7
 * 100 100 50 40 40 20 10
 * 4
 * 5 25 50 120
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Sample Output (Dense Ranking)</h3>
 * <pre><code>
 * 6
 * 4
 * 2
 * 1
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Sample Output (Competition Ranking)</h3>
 * <pre><code>
 * 8
 * 6
 * 3
 * 1
