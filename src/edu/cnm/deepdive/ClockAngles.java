/**
 * The static methods of this class compute the angles to which the hands of a clock will be
 * oriented at a given time of day.
 * <p>
 * Some of the method names contain the word "Degrees". The value returned by each of these should
 * be an angle in degrees, measured clockwise from straight up (12 o'clock on the clock face).
 * Another way to think of this angle is that it follows the conventions used when reading a
 * compass. The values returned should be in the interval [0, 360) &ndash; that is, from 0
 * (inclusive) to 360 (exclusive).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Other methods contain the word "Radians"; these methods (for extra credit) should return angles
 * in radians, measured counter-clockwise from the positive X-axis (3 o'clock on the clock face). In
 * other words, these angles follow the conventions of analytic geometry. The value returned by each
 * of these methods should be in the range [0, 2&pi;).
 * </p>
 * <h3>Assumptions</h3>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The value of the <code>hours</code> parameter will always be in the
 * range 0 to 23, inclusive. (Note that your code shouldn't care whether a 12-hour or 24-hour clock
 * is being used.)</li>
 * <li>The value of the <code>minutes</code> parameter will always be in the
 * real-valued interval [0, 60) &ndash; that is a floating-point number ranging from 0 (inclusive)
 * to 60 (exclusive).</li>
 * <li>The angle of the minute hand doesn't depend at all on the hour;
 * however, the angle of the hour hand depends on both hour and minutes, since the hour hand on the
 * clock face advances even as the minutes advance.</li>
 * <li>Since non-integral computations are almost always inexact, results
 * need only be accurate to within 0.01&deg;, or (approximately) 0.00017 radians.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h3>Basic test cases</h3>
 * <p>
 * Please note that the values below are guaranteed to be included in the test cases; others may be
 * included at our discretion. However, if your code works correctly with the cases below, and
 * assuming it doesn't simply have hard-coded conditions looking for these specific inpupt values,
 * it should have no problem with additional test values. In other words, your code should include
 * the necessary computations to handle general cases, and not just those shown here.
